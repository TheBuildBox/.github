## Hi there 👋



<!--

**Here are some ideas to get you started:**

🙋‍♀️ A short introduction - what is your organization all about?
🌈 Contribution guidelines - how can the community get involved?
👩‍💻 Useful resources - where can the community find your docs? Is there anything else the community should know?
🍿 Fun facts - what does your team eat for breakfast?
🧙 Remember, you can do mighty things with the power of [Markdown](https://docs.github.com/github/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax)

This is the home of the buildbox, a tool to build and package software projects in linux containers using pre-created container images.

The main repo providing the mechanisms to build the images as well as the [builbo](https://github.com/TheBuildBox/buildbox/blob/main/cli/builbo) command line tool is [buildbox](https://github.com/TheBuildBox/buildbox).

`builbo` needs dpodman  or docker to run containersand can easily be installed to `/usr/local/bin`  on a Linux  or macOS system with  sudo privileges using the following command.

```console
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheBuildBox/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
```
